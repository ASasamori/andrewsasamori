So I actually was only at Boston University for three school years! I started during the Summer Term in May 2022. For my freshman year of college, I attended University of Hawaii at Manoa. Culturally it was not for me, and I have since ommited this information from my resume and LinkedIn. Of course, I miss Hawaii.

> I never explicitly wrote "Transferred" on my resume and a lot of employers thought that I graduated in one year.

Anyways, here is my unofficial transcript when I graduated if you're interested about that.

## TL;DR
Had a 3.63 GPA. You're right, I get to put > 3.5 for some employers and < 3.75 for others. At graduation, they decided to announce I got Cum Laude when really had not gotten it. Prankt
