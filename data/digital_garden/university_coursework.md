So I actually was only at Boston University for three school years! I started during the Summer Term in May 2022. For my freshman year of college, I attended University of Hawaii at Manoa. Culturally it was not for me, and I have since ommited this information from my resume and LinkedIn. Of course, I miss Hawaii.

I never explicitly wrote "Transferred" on my resume and a lot of employers thought that I graduated in one year.
