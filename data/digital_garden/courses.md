This foundational course introduced me to:
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs
- **Algorithm Analysis**: Big O notation, time and space complexity
- **Problem Solving**: Breaking down complex problems into manageable parts

**Key Takeaway**: Understanding that choosing the right data structure is often more important than writing clever code.

### CS 330: Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms
**Professor**: Leonid Levin
**Semester**: Spring 2023

Advanced algorithmic thinking including:
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems
- **Graph Algorithms**: Dijkstra's, Floyd-Warshall, network flows
- **Complexity Theory**: P vs NP, reduction techniques

**Mind-Blowing Moment**: Learning about the theoretical limits of computation and why some problems might be fundamentally hard.

### CS 460: Database Systems
**Professor**: Manos Athanassoulis
**Semester**: Fall 2023

Deep dive into database internals:
- **Storage Systems**: B+ trees, LSM trees, buffer management
- **Query Processing**: Query optimization, execution plans
- **Transaction Management**: ACID properties, concurrency control
- **Distributed Systems**: Consensus, replication, consistency models

**Project Highlight**: Built a mini database engine from scratch - gave me immense respect for database engineers.

## Mathematics Foundation

### CS 131: Combinatorics
**Professor**: Mark Kon
**Semester**: Spring 2022

Mathematical foundations crucial for CS:
- **Counting Principles**: Permutations, combinations, inclusion-exclusion
- **Graph Theory**: Planar graphs, coloring, matching
- **Discrete Probability**: Random variables, expectation, concentration bounds

**Real-World Application**: These concepts appear everywhere in algorithm analysis and system design.

### CS 237: Probability in Computing

**Team Project**: The async batch processing system that became one of my main projects.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **Theory Informs Practice**
Mathematical foundations aren't abstract - they directly impact how we build systems.

### 2. **Systems Thinking**
Computer science is about understanding complex interactions between components.

### 3. **Trade-offs Everywhere**
Every design decision involves trade-offs between time, space, complexity, and maintainability.

### 4. **Collaboration Matters**
The best learning happened in study groups and team projects.

## Looking Forward

These courses provided the foundation for:
- **System Design**: Understanding how large-scale systems work
- **Algorithm Design**: Approaching problems systematically
- **Research Skills**: Reading papers, implementing ideas, evaluating solutions
- **Engineering Mindset**: Building reliable, efficient, maintainable systems

The journey through computer science education has been challenging but incredibly rewarding. Each course built upon the previous ones, creating a coherent understanding of computational thinking and system design.
